== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Which Payment Gateway this plugin support? =

Currently it supports PayPal, Cardcom, iCount, PayMe, iCredit, with another new payment gateway added every month.

= How does Simple Payment complies with PCI-DSS =

When a payment is passed through the plugin, it restricts the use of sensible data to the minimum possible, 
avoids any replication of variables and data, and upon saving on the database is masks and hides the data
so no sensible data is saved in the database.

Additional it allows you to automaticaly purge any records older the X days.

= Can I work with Simple Payments and other plugins =

Simple Payment is ready to be extended, it exposes actions and filters (add_action & add_filters), to hook
in differnet parts of the payment process.

You can also extend any of the existing Payment Gateways (Engines) or write your own Custom Engine, and finally
you can integrate Simple Payment with [Zapier](https://zapier.com/developer/public-invite/66167/f63e9e617b9e5e534c26c308f15087ee/)
